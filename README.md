## fem-react

This is a repo documenting the progress as I follow along the Intro to React v4 course on Frontend Masters.

Instead of using the PetfinderAPI, I decided to branch out and use axios as the HTTP client for the browser (still learning)

Things I've learned along the way:

1. Watching React v4 course on FEM, exploring some super cool features on VS Code
2. Parcel is also super cool - installs packages with minimal config, sets up localhost and installs dependencies
3. literal LIGHTBULB moment on VS code - click lightbulb, move to new file (e.g. React component > Parks > Parks.js
4. took me so long to figure out, but I finally figured out AXIOS! with react using a css-tricks tutorial - go me!
5. Edit your App.js, please go ahead and edit your Park.js file to make sure your naming conventions are up to date
6. *kind of* learned how State works in React, will need to do more on that for sure
7. *bumpy ride* but finally figured out how to fetch data to render just one result on details.js page
8. Always try to use .map() for data calls or api or whatever they are. The days with .forEach are kinda over, so be careful
9. took me extra long to figure out how to render a prop from one component to another, but i figured it out!
10. learned about scopes, need to revisit this later (in Carousel.js -> click handler > instead of writing a classic function, we used the arrow functions instead)
