## fem-react

This is a repo documenting the progress as I follow along the Intro to React v4 course on Frontend Masters.

Instead of using the PetfinderAPI, I decided to branch out and use axios as the HTTP client for the browser (still learning)

Things I've learned along the way:

1. Watching React v4 course on FEM, exploring some super cool features on VS Code
2. Parcel is also super cool - installs packages with minimal config, sets up localhost and installs dependencies
3. literal LIGHTBULB moment on VS code - click lightbulb, move to new file (e.g. React component > Parks > Parks.js
4. took me so long to figure out, but I finally figured out AXIOS! with react using a css-tricks tutorial - go me!
5. Edit your App.js, please go ahead and edit your Park.js file to make sure your naming conventions are up to date
6. *kind of* learned how State works in React, will need to do more on that for sure
